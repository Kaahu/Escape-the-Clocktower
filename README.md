# Escape-the-Clocktower
Escape the Clocktower (EtC) is a first-person grid-based dungeon-crawler being developed exclusively for Andrew Trotman’s laptop. EtC will feature a step-based movement system, 120 by 180 black and white image display, compelling bureaucracy-based puzzle-solving, and a host of colourful (though not literally) characters to interact with. The game takes place in the fictional institution of Ogato University in a parallel universe not entirely unlike our own. You play as the protagonist: an unnamed student who has woken up in the top floor of the university’s clocktower. Armed with nothing but a hangover and a bed-sheet toga, can you avoid humiliation, dodge expulsion, and, ultimately, escape the clocktower
