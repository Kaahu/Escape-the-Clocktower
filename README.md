# Escape-the-Clocktower
Escape the Clocktower (EtC) is a first-person grid-based dungeon-crawler EtC will feature a step-based movement system, compelling bureaucracy-based puzzle-solving, and a host of colourful (though not literally) characters to interact with. 

The game takes place in the fictional institution of Ogato University in a parallel universe not entirely unlike our own. You play as the protagonist: an unnamed student who has woken up in the top floor of the universityâ€™s clocktower. Armed with nothing but a hangover and a bed-sheet toga, can you avoid humiliation, dodge expulsion, faceless bureaucrats and, ultimately, escape the clocktower.
